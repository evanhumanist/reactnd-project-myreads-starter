# MyReads Project
This is Project 6 in the Udacity/Google Frontend Nanodegree course. I was lucky enough to be one of the recipients of a scholarship for this course and I'm super excited to work through the remaining challenges ahead!

## Dependencies
1. A modern Web Browser (Vivaldi, Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Safari, Edge etc...).
2. npm must be installed.

Clone this repo to your local machine using:

`git clone https://github.com/evanhumanist/reactnd-project-myreads-starter`

## Running Locally

2. Start the development server with `npm start`

## Instructions

* To move a book to a different shelf, click the book's selector and choose the destination shelf.
* To search for a new book:
    * Click the plus icon on the bottom right corner of the screen.
    * Type the search term into the search input field.
    * Add a book to one of your shelves by clicking the book's selector and choosing the destination shelf.
* Remove books from your shelf by clicking the book's selector and choosing the `None` selection.
